## Environment Variables
There are two ways to set a whitelist:

`HUBOT_WHITELIST` - A comma separated list (no spaces). `HUBOT_WHITELIST=random,general`
`HUBOT_WHITELIST_PATH` - Set the path (relative to your hubot directory) to a `json`/`js`/`coffee` file that returns an array of whitelisted channels.
